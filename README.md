# Ludum-Dares
A place for all the Ludum Dare events I take part on.

Ludum Dare 32 - Theme: An Unconventional Weapon (Pixel graphics provided by a friend)
What this incomplete entry intended to make was a strategy game where the player used their soldiers in unconventional ways to conquer the world. Furthermore, there were special generals who, aside from using unconventional weapons themselves, had abilities that used the soldiers in unorthodox ways as a means to defeating the opposition.

Ludum Dare 34 - Theme: Two Button Controls, Growing (The very first tie for a theme in Ludum Dare history!)
This incomplete entry intended to mix the game Divekick and the game Brawlhalla into something different. Divekick came with the movement. The player would be able simply jump and attack.
Brawlhalla came with the power system (which in turn takes from the game series Super Smash Brothers), even if somewhat inverted. The idea was that the more hits the player got, the harder he'd hit his foes. There was a complete combo system planned out and everything. All with just two buttons.

Ludum Dare 35 - Theme: Shapeshift
This entry, the very first one I completed, was intended to be a game in isometric view where the player's objective was to walk through a city looking to assassinate someone, but that someone knows what the player looks like. As such, the player had a need to snatch people and killing them to take their form. However, when the bodies were found, the target received an update on how the player looked, forcing him/her to keep changing. The player would not be capable of taking out the target if it knew how they looked.

Ludum Dare 36 - Theme: Ancient Technology
This incomplete entry wanted to try something different. I had decided to knock the rust of my C++ and try to make a roguelike. The idea was to create a small station belnging to an ancient civilization that the player would explore. The player would soon be forced to start salvaging items and weapons from inside the station by realizing their technology was innefective at surviving the creatures that roam inside. The objective was merely to learn the station's history and leave. However, and while this would likely have never made it to the game even if I had manged to use all 48 hours, this station belonged to an ancient civilization. As such, they did not speak the player's language, which meant that the player would have to learn that too. Well, they'd learn it passively, at least. As more and more logs the player would find regarding the station's history, more and more words would eventually start appearing in English until the player was capable of understanding everything.
But issues with the IDE I was using and the library I was trying to link to forced me to try and make this game with something else. I went to try to use GameMaker, but that didn't provide me with the functionality I needed so, restarting for a second time, I ended up going back to Unity, but by this time I had already lost nearly a day, sadly, which turned this into the worst of my Ludum Dare attempts. At least in terms of completion.
