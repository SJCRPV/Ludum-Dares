> Theme: Running Out Of Power

This entry resulted in an actual submission in the Jam version (72 hours instead of 48)
It’s a prototype for an event-driven game. The player is put in charge of a colony ship on its way to a new planet to inhabit, but at the start, they do not have enough resources to get to the end. They need to manage their slowly draining resources of: power, morale and lives. This can be done so through picking the right responses for each event or by waiting at the system the ship is in to generate power. However, waiting too long will just cause another event to fire, so it’s best to not push your luck. At any time, should the player decide that the situation is hopeless, they are allowed to do a final speech for the entire ship.

> Theme: Shapeshift

This entry, the very first one I completed, was intended to be a game in isometric view where the player's objective was to walk through a city looking to assassinate someone, but that someone knows what the player looks like. As such, the player had a need to snatch people and killing them to take their form. However, when the bodies were found, the target received an update on how the player looked, forcing him/her to keep changing. The player would not be capable of taking out the target if it knew how they looked.

## **Ludum Dare 46**
> Theme: Keep it alive

What I tried to do in this attempt was to both learn how to use Unity’s Tilemap features, and to try out and learn how to use the SOLID programming principles. Additionally, I was in the mood to make a roguelike, so I adapted the theme into one. The resulting idea ended up with me wanting to make a game about a golem with an exposed flame in its core that is constantly waning. It could be replenished by absorbing other fires, but the vegetation is not enough and so, after reaching a nearby town rumoured to have an eternal flame, the golem decides to steal to avoid this constant struggle for survival. It is not a fighter, though, and the townsfolk are not friendly to golems, so the player must stealth their way around the town and figure out where it might be.

I didn’t get close to completing it, but I got to try out these new features and ideas.

## **Ludum Dare 44**
> Theme: Your life is currency

My main objective during this event was to attempt something related to a rhythm game, as I had yet to try it. It was played over simple combat where the player had to input attacks either from the left or the right, each with an "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT" and "RIGHT" modifiers. But because life was currency, every single input the player gave would cost them health. The only way to mitigate that would be to make the right inputs at the right time, as they did more damage to the enemy. When it comes to the rhythm system, I succeeded in learning what I wanted, which I suppose was what caused me to then lose the will to continue at the end, as my goal had been acheived.

## **Ludum Dare 42**
> Theme: Running Out Of Space

The entire game was to be played inside a backpack where the player was tasked with assessing any new items that came in and manage the space while keeping the best gear. Not picking the best items would result in the hero losing health more quickly due to the non-ideal equipment. The hero would also ask to swap out the equipment, depending on what it would be fighting. But at the same time, the hero wouldn’t always be right and it would make sense to ignore him at times. The objective would be to simply last for as long as
possible.

## **Ludum Dare 38**
> Theme: Small World

In this entry, I intended to create a god-game. A whole world that the player could manipulate in order to create life, but with a bit more to it.
Thematically, at least. Since the theme was “Small World”, the idea I eventually ended up going with was that the playing area was a literal sandbox. The player would be seeing things through the eyes and imagination of a child. Things would start with just a bunch of sand and, as the player messed with the environment, they would begin to look like an actual environment, with grass, mountains, trees, water, volcanoes… etc.
As various conditions were met, certain areas would start to have creatures appearing. Life. Be it things like molten, salamander-like creatures if volcanoes, rocks, lava and scorching temperatures were around; or furry, yeti-like creatures if there was water, ice, snow and frigid temperatures; or even just your usual life, if water, plains, trees and mild temperature existed in an area. Unfortunately, I spent too much time learning how to make the world deformation mechanics to get all that far in this vision.

## **Ludum Dare 36**
> Theme: Ancient Technology

This incomplete entry wanted to try something different. I had decided to knock the rust of my C++ and try to make a roguelike. The idea was to create a small station belnging to an ancient civilization that the player would explore. The player would soon be forced to start salvaging items and weapons from inside the station by realizing their technology was innefective at surviving the creatures that roam inside. The objective was merely to learn the station's history and leave. However, and while this would likely have never made it to the game even if I had manged to use all 48 hours, this station belonged to an ancient civilization. As such, they did not speak the player's language, which meant that the player would have to learn that too. Well, they'd learn it passively, at least. As more and more logs the player would find regarding the station's history, more and more words would eventually start appearing in English until the player was capable of understanding everything.
But issues with the IDE I was using and the library I was trying to link to forced me to try and make this game with something else. I went to try to use GameMaker, but that didn't provide me with the functionality I needed so, restarting for a second time, I ended up going back to Unity, but by this time I had already lost nearly a day, sadly, which turned this into the worst of my Ludum Dare attempts. At least in terms of completion.

## **Ludum Dare 34**
> Theme: Two Button Controls, Growing (The very first tie for a theme in Ludum Dare history!)

This incomplete entry intended to mix the game Divekick and the game Brawlhalla into something different. Divekick came with the movement. The player would be able simply jump and attack.
Brawlhalla came with the power system (which in turn takes from the game series Super Smash Brothers), even if somewhat inverted. The idea was that the more hits the player got, the harder he'd hit his foes. There was a complete combo system planned out and everything. All with just two buttons.

## **Ludum Dare 32**
> Theme: An Unconventional Weapon (Pixel graphics provided by a friend)

What this incomplete entry intended to make was a strategy game where the player used their soldiers in unconventional ways to conquer the world. Furthermore, there were special generals who, aside from using unconventional weapons themselves, had abilities that used the soldiers in unorthodox ways as a means to defeating the opposition.

# Personal Reminders
## **Ludum Dare 45**
> Theme: Start with nothing

This game was an exercise in limiting myself to a very simple concept that I could perhaps complete in 48 hours. I did not succeed for two reasons. I failed to constrain it to something simple enough. My focus on something I could complete worked against me for I did not enjoy the idea enough to follow through on something that's intended to be fun. To the point where I don't think it's worthwhile to even explain the idea. It is here for posterity, and as a reminder for myself.
