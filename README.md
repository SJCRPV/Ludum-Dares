# Ludum-Dares
A place for all the Ludum Dare events I take part on.

Ludum Dare 32 - Theme: An Unconventional Weapon (Pixel graphics provided by a friend)
What this incomplete entry intended to make was a strategy game where the player used their soldiers in unconventional ways to conquer the world. Furthermore, there were special generals who, aside from using unconventional weapons themselves, had abilities that used the soldiers in unorthodox ways as a means to defeating the opposition.

Ludum Dare 34 - Theme: Two Button Controls, Growing (The very first tie for a theme in Ludum Dare history!)
This incomplete entry intended to mix the game Divekick and the game Brawlhalla into something different. Divekick came with the movement. The player would be able simply jump and attack.
Brawlhalla came with the power system (which in turn takes from the game series Super Smash Brothers), even if somewhat inverted. The idea was that the more hits the player got, the harder he'd hit his foes. There was a complete combo system planned out and everything. All with just two buttons.

Ludum Dare 35 - Theme: Shapeshift
This entry, the very first one I completed, was intended to be a game in isometric view where your objective was to walk through a city looking to assassinate someone, but that someone knows what you look like so you need to snatch people and killing them to take their form. However, when the bodies were found, the target received an update on how you looked, forcing you to keep changing. The player would not be capable of taking out the target if it knew how you looked.
